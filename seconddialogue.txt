Soldier: Stop
Soldier: Dammed murder...
!!!----------------------Forest------------------------!!!
Soldier: You will not reach the exit
Soldier: It's not first time one of you has tried to run away using that path before 
You fall over 
and continue
It seems like the persecutors have lost your track
You can rest
In front of you there's a cave, do you want to go there?
	>> Introduce '1' to hide into the cave
	>> Introduce '2' to ignore it
#cave1#
!!!------------------------Cave------------------------!!!
Wolf: Grrr...
It's very threatening 
It moves closer to you
Wolf: GRRRRR 
Suddenly a pack of wolves surround you
Do you use a spell?
	>> Introduce '1' to use it
	>> Introduce '2' to don't attack
#cave1a#
The pack approaches you and breaks you into pieces
#cave1b#
You raise your hands as a sign of surrender
You close your eyes and keep silence 
...
...
...
You open them 
Naked and dirty men and women treat you with respect
#object1#
Werewolf: I give you this special object. Think of it like an investment
Werewolf: Com'on, it doesn't hurt. Try to use it
Suspiciously, you watch the pack
#object2#
Werewolf: Now, show us your strength. 
Com'on! Fight against me! 
#forest1b#
You have been murdered
A spear pierced you on the back 
Soldier: Finally I found you, foolish magician
Exactly, the creator was here
Wrong entry
You only can choose '1' or '2', I'm afraid
Something is near...
